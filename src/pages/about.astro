			      I'm Juan Pablo, a generative AI engineer and fiction writer living in Sonoma, California. My work sits at the intersection of language, emotion, and systems design.
			    </p>
		
			    <p class="mb-4">
			      I come from a background in natural language processing and have spent years helping teams bring meaning to messy data, from intelligence analysis to creative storytelling tools. But my focus has shifted—less about optimization, more about presence. I'm building tools I believe in. And writing stories I need to tell.
			    </p>
			    <p class="mb-4">
			      You may find me leading AI projects or writing from a sunlit corner with Jessy nearby. I’m always chasing that feeling where purpose and presence meet. This site is a living record of that search.

				<h2 class="section-title">Education</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>I earned my M.S. in Data Science from American University, where I combined a strong foundation in statistics and machine learning with a deep curiosity about language and human systems. It’s where I learned how to think in models and how to ask better questions.</p>

				<h2 class="section-title">Skills</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>
					  I'm fluent in designing, building, and evaluating generative AI systems. My toolbox includes Python, FastAPI, LangChain, and Hugging Face, with deep hands-on experience deploying models on the cloud and managing pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker. I lead with both technical clarity and creative instinct.
					</p>
					<p>
					  Beyond code, I'm a systems thinker, a writer, and a fierce advocate for simplicity in product design.
